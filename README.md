# Wattanite Refactor

This repository took an existing project, built by one of our colleagues in Codeworks, and refactored it.

Wattanite is an app that allows you and your friends/family to vote on a movie watch and restaurant to order from for the night.
It was built out of frustration of sitting on Netflix too long without any decisions being made.

For the refactor we (Alex & Simon):

- Converted the client and server to TypeScript from plain Javascript

- Added WebSockets to the app so that multiple users could vote.

- Refactored the backend endpoints

- Added Testing to the frontend and backend
